OL,7,Fplanning to stage a protest over what

OL,12,FThe Lido Steering Group's chair,
OL,13,FDeputy David Warr, revealed that 'Love

OL,15,Fhad lost its status as the "preferred

OL,7,Fheld in the Royal Square ahead of a
OL,8,FStates sitting on Tuesday 11 November
OL,9,F"if meaningful negotiations are not re-

OL,12,FHe adds that the collapse of the 'Love
OL,13,FOur Lido' bid, led by local
OL,14,Fbusinessman Matt Falla, stemmed from
OL,15,F"several fundamental issues",
OL,16,Fincluding concerns over a lack of

OL,19,Fcould become the responsibility of

OL,9,Fof maintaining the site, according to

OL,12,F"Furthermore, every 10 years, a
