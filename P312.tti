OL,11,FWorld Rowing was alerted to the

OL,12,F''With the rowing world being in the

OL,6,F''I would have thought that World

OL,11,Ffor all, especially with something
OL,12,Fthat should have been so easily and

OL,16,FSinclair told ITV News he first
OL,17,Fcontacted World Rowing about the video
OL,18,Fon June 5 and received a reply on the
OL,19,Fsame day from its European President,
OL,20,FAnnamarie Phelps, who acknowledged the

OL,12,FSinclair sent multiple follow-up
