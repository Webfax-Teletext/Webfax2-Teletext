OL,6,FEarlier this year, Joe decided to

OL,8,Fhousehold, by establishing a junior

OL,11,FJoe explained: "We had an open day,
OL,12,Fwhich I was expecting 10-12 children
OL,13,Fto turn up to and I think we had 49 on
OL,14,Ffour boards, which was hard work. But
OL,15,Fdo you know what, everyone enjoyed it,
OL,16,Feveryone really enjoyed it."
OL,18,FA few months later, there are two
OL,19,Fweekly sessions attended by boys and
OL,20,Fgirls of all ages, which Joe puts down
OL,21,Fto the 'Luke Littler effect'
