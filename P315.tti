OL,10,FIn front of 16,845 fans - a new record
OL,11,Ffor Wales' women - the opening 20
OL,12,Fminutes were uneventful. There were
OL,13,Fnerves and heavy touches as players
OL,14,Feased their way into the match with a
OL,15,Fcagey opening stanza.
OL,17,FThe visitors settled fastest, passed
OL,18,Fwith accuracy and pressed with
OL,19,Fintensity. Rhian Wilkinson's side were
OL,20,Fstruggling to find their rhythm and
OL,21,FJess Fishlock was a bystander.

OL,8,Finto space for the first time down the

OL,11,Fand it fell to Lily Woodham at the

OL,15,FThe goal did little to dampen Irish

OL,18,Flook sharp through the middle of the

OL,6,FWales struggled to cause their

OL,8,Fof the match. Ireland did nothing with
OL,9,Fwhat little possession they had but
OL,10,Flooked comfortable defending in their
OL,11,Fown half. Midway through the second
OL,12,F45, the game was in desperate need of
OL,13,Fa spark.
OL,15,FThere was a flashpoint just after the

OL,17,FRachel Rowe with her elbow, much to
