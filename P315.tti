OL,6,FLeicester are hoping to avoid a repeat
OL,7,Fof their relegation season in 2022/23,
OL,8,Fwhen a slow decline under Brendan
OL,9,FRodgers eventually led to them heading
OL,10,Fto the Championship. They believe they
OL,11,Fsacked him too late.
OL,13,FFormer Brighton and Chelsea boss
OL,14,FGraham Potter was approached at that
OL,15,Fstage but he declined the opportunity.
OL,17,FHe also turned Leicester down when
OL,18,FEnzo Maresca got the job. Could the
OL,19,Fstars align this time?
