OL,7,Fbut sometimes the scoreline doesn't
OL,8,Ftell the whole story.
OL,10,FThis was an afternoon where Welsh
OL,11,Frugby showed signs of life for the
OL,12,Ffirst time in two years.
OL,14,FUltimately the losing run continues
OL,15,Fbut things were not as ugly as many
OL,16,Ffeared they might be.
OL,18,FFor a dizzying spell either side of

OL,20,Fsince the early exchanges against Fiji
OL,21,Fback in November.
