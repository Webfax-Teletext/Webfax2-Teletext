OL,9,Fyesterday (17 November).
OL,11,FDolly-Rae Budworth was selected as a
OL,12,Fmascot after her dad, Adam, nominated
OL,13,Fher last year.
OL,15,FShe was given the opportunity to wear
OL,16,Fthe Irish kit, watch the players warm
OL,17,Fup, escort player Callum O'Dowda out
OL,18,Fof the tunnel and onto the pitch, and
OL,19,Fthen watch the match from prime

OL,4,Cgirl chosen as football mascot
OL,6,FSpeaking about the experience, Dolly
OL,7,Fsaid: "At the start I was a bit
OL,8,Fnervous, but once I got out there, I
OL,9,Fthought - actually it isn't that bad!
OL,11,F"I was told where to look for my dad,
OL,12,Fso I looked up at him during the
OL,13,Fnational anthem."
OL,15,FThe match was watched by almost 80,000
OL,16,Fpeople, and Dolly thought the
OL,17,Fatmosphere was amazing.
OL,19,FShe adds that she was inspired by
OL,20,Fmeeting some of her favourite football
OL,21,Fstars.

OL,4,Cgirl chosen as football mascot
OL,6,F"My favourite bit was high-fiving all
OL,7,Fof the players. I high-fived Jude
OL,8,FBellingham, Kyle Walker, and I shook
OL,9,Fthe Irish manager's hand. The whole
OL,10,Fday was amazing."
OL,12,FAdding an element of tension to her
OL,13,Fparticipation, however, is the fact
OL,14,Fthat Dolly's national allegiance is
OL,15,Fsplit: her mum is Irish, whilst her
OL,16,Fdad is English. So where do Dolly's
OL,17,Floyalties lie?
OL,19,FShe says: "I was (an Irish) mascot but
OL,20,F... if I had a preference it would
OL,21,Fprobably have been England."
