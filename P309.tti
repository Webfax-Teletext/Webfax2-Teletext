OL,7,FWriting for the Players' Tribune,
OL,8,FToone said she was still trying to

OL,11,Ffather had not explained to her how
OL,12,Fill he was until near the end.
OL,14,F"When he passed, it was a big shock,
OL,15,Feven to some of the people closest to
OL,16,Fhim, because no one hardly knew he was
OL,17,Fill," Toone wrote.
OL,19,F"People ask me now, 'Why didn't you
OL,20,Ftell us?' And I'm like, I didn't know
OL,21,Feither. I didn't know half of it...
