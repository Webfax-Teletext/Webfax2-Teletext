OL,6,FFor those of us old enough, it conjurs
OL,7,Fup memories of a very famous milk
OL,8,Fadvert from the 1980s. While for some
OL,9,FAccrington players, as David Chisnall
OL,10,Fhas been finding out, it's the
OL,11,Frealisation of a lifelong dream.
OL,13,FLiverpool FC legend Ian Rush says he
OL,14,F"still drinks milk today" and will be
OL,15,Fdoing so when Accrington Stanley take
OL,16,Fon his team in the FA Cup third round
OL,17,Ftie.

OL,6,FThe Welsh former footballer, 63, said
OL,7,Fhe may be famous for being the club's
OL,8,Frecord goalscorer but more people know
OL,9,Fhim from the now cult Milk Marketing
OL,10,FBoard advert from 1989.
OL,12,FIt features two Scouse boys in
OL,13,FLiverpool kits who come home from a
OL,14,Fkick-about. One of the boys pours
OL,15,Fhimself a glass of lemonade - much to
OL,16,Fhis friend's disgust.

OL,12,F"Accrington Stanley, who are they?"
