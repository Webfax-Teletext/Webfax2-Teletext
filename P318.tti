OL,6,FDaniel Dubois is poised to take his

OL,8,FSaturday with the winner set to become
OL,9,Fthe undisputed heavyweight champion.
OL,11,FThe pair will square off at Wembley
OL,12,FStadium on Saturday night, almost two
OL,13,Fyears after their first bout, which is
OL,14,Fbest remembered for a controversial
OL,15,Flow blow by Dubois. Usyk stopped
OL,16,FDubois in the ninth round to retain
OL,17,Fseveral titles.
OL,19,FVictory for Usyk (23-0, 14 KOs) would
OL,20,Fsee the Ukrainian become a two-time
OL,21,Fundisputed heavyweight champion.
