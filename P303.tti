OL,11,FIn Spain, the trial of Luis Rubiales
OL,12,Fmeans so much more than whether he is

OL,14,Ftrying to coerce a World Cup winner to
OL,15,Fconvince an outraged public that his

OL,6,FIt's almost as if the verdict is
OL,7,Fincidental, because the fact that the
OL,8,Fformer boss of the Spanish football

OL,10,Fbeen banned by FIFA and must now
OL,11,Fdefend himself in a criminal court, is
OL,12,Fa victory in itself.
OL,14,FBut for many, Rubiales' guilt would be
OL,15,Fa delicious conclusion to a
OL,16,Fconversation about sexism that has
