OL,7,FThe charity said the rise might have

OL,10,Finto sports settings in recent years,
OL,11,Fas well as increased knowledge about
OL,12,Fthe helpline.
OL,14,FThe NSPCC said the jump also "possibly
OL,15,Fshows a rise in the abuse of children
OL,16,Fin sports settings", but noted that
OL,17,Fadult survivors have also been
OL,18,Freporting historic abuse to the
