OL,6,FSpeaking on ITV Meridian's 'The Last
OL,7,FWord', Sir Christopher said: "I myself
OL,8,Fam supporting Robert Jenrick because I
OL,9,Fthink he's brought more energy and
OL,10,Fcommitment to the campaign, and being
OL,11,Fleader of the opposition is a really

OL,14,F"And, much as I like Kemi, I think
OL,15,Fshe's preoccupied with her own

OL,17,Fthink Robert's children are a bit
OL,18,Folder, and I think that it's important
OL,19,Fthat whoever leads the opposition has
OL,20,Fgot an immense amount of time and
