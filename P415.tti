OL,12,FIt comes two years after families in

OL,14,Funnecessarily, and many more were
OL,15,Fsubject to avoidable harm, because

OL,7,Fin October 2022 by Dr Bill Kirkup,
OL,8,Ffound that mothers and babies were
OL,9,Fsystematically failed at the William

OL,13,FThen in May 2023, the health watchdog

OL,17,Fto 'inadequate'.
OL,19,FIn the year to March 2024 - NHS data
