OL,6,FFor a brief moment Vitor Pereira
OL,7,Funited a fanbase. Out drinking with
OL,8,Fsupporters after wins, he was the down-
OL,9,Fto-earth boss who made Wolves tick.
OL,11,FThat's why it is so sad to see the
OL,12,Fbreakdown in his relationship with the
OL,13,Fclub's fans in just six months.
OL,15,FThe nadir was reached on Sunday as he
OL,16,Fwas dragged away from the South Bank
OL,17,Fwith fans chanting "You're getting

OL,12,FWith just two points from nine games,
OL,13,Fthis is even worse than Gary O'Neil's
OL,14,Fstart to last season.
OL,16,FO'Neil had terrible fixtures that

OL,6,FWolves have sold their best players in

OL,13,Fworked for Wolves, but it now shows
OL,14,Fsigns of breaking with disastrous

OL,17,FLadislav Krejci is possibly the only
