OL,6,FWhen Joe Fraser was five-years-old, he
OL,7,Fwas a bundle of energy and like many
OL,8,Fparents, his mum and dad knew he
OL,9,Fneeded to channel it positively.
OL,11,FSo, they took him to their local
OL,12,Fgymnastics club, and Joe said the rest
OL,13,Fwas history as he fell in love with
OL,14,Fthe sport.
OL,16,FIn his words, "it felt like flying".
OL,17,FIt is something so many people can
OL,18,Fonly imagine but for Joe, it is almost
OL,19,Fa reality.
