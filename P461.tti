OL,8,Fhow the four regional clubs will be
OL,9,Ffunded as "very disappointing".
OL,11,FOn Sunday (18 May) the WRU revealed it
OL,12,Fwould no longer be evenly funding all
OL,13,Ffour clubs after Ospreys and Scarlets
OL,14,Fdid not sign up to its new
OL,15,FProfessional Rugby Agreement (PRA25) -
OL,16,Fwhile Dragons and Cardiff did.
