OL,8,F1 Test series victory in Australia
OL,9,Fduring the first ever women's rugby
OL,10,Fleague tour.
OL,12,FTo this day, they are the only women's
OL,13,Fteam in Europe to beat Australia in a
OL,14,Ftest series despite having to raise
OL,15,Ftheir own funds for travel and
OL,16,Faccommodation.
OL,18,FJane Banks was 16 when she was picked
OL,19,Ffor the Lioness squad, and remembers
