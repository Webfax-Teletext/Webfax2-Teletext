OL,10,Fwasn't aware of the fact that it was
OL,11,Fthe minute of silence.
OL,13,F"He was just still happy and tried to
OL,14,Fcheer for his team. And I think then
OL,15,Fthe fans of Palace were trying to calm
OL,16,Fthat person or those persons down, so
OL,17,FI don't think he had a bad intention,
OL,18,Fthe guy or people that made noise.
