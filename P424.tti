OL,9,FThe tears of joy, the emotion, the

OL,11,For 70 years, of hurt we're talking

OL,13,Fespecially a major domestic trophy, is
OL,14,Fan event that's passing out of living

OL,6,FThese are all interesting questions to

OL,9,FNewcastle United win on Sunday? WILL
OL,10,FNewcastle United win on Sunday?
OL,12,FThe bookmakers will tell you it's
OL,13,Funlikely. Liverpool are strong
OL,14,Ffavourites and rightly so. They're the
OL,15,Fbest team in the land this season and,

OL,7,FFirst, Newcastle United aren't plucky

OL,11,FEddie Howe's team are one of the
