OL,7,FMark Bullingham said the FA had
OL,8,F"massive growth aspirations" for the
OL,9,Fsport, and played down the idea that
OL,10,Fhosting the tournament could help pave
OL,11,Fthe way for a men's World Cup bid in

OL,14,F"We think it's a really big event in
OL,15,Fits own right", Bullingham said. "That
OL,16,Fwould mean we have the 2028 men's
OL,17,FEuros, and if we are successful, the
OL,18,F2035 women's World Cup, which would be
