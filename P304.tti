OL,16,FAs teams would travel with several

OL,6,FGary explains: "We appreciate that
OL,7,FOrkney has very limited hotel
OL,8,Faccommodation and that the organising
OL,9,Fcommittee has been doing everything
OL,10,Fpossible to increase capacity by
OL,11,Fsetting up temporary accommodation in

OL,14,F"Unfortunately, the accommodation we

OL,6,FThe GFA Board concluded that the type

OL,8,Finability to meet safeguarding

OL,13,FGary adds: "We know this will come as

OL,15,Fbut the GFA will be actively looking
OL,16,Ffor alternative opportunities for off-
