OL,7,FDarts legend Phil Taylor has backed
OL,8,Fteenager Luke Littler to break his
OL,9,Frecord - but adds that he must first
OL,10,Fovercome the 'Man United' syndrome.
OL,12,F17-year-old Luke became the youngest
OL,13,Fplayer ever to clinch the World
OL,14,FChampionship when he beat Michael van
OL,15,FGerwen in the final earlier this month.
OL,17,FNow Phil Taylor says the Warrington-
OL,18,Fborn champ can surpass even his
OL,19,Fsuccess at the oche, but it comes at a
OL,20,Fprice.
