OL,6,FThe RSPCA has called on football clubs
OL,7,Fand the public to help save animals by
OL,8,Fputting away nets following the end of
OL,9,Fthe season.
OL,11,FThe charity said it received 1,355
OL,12,Freports in 2024 of animals getting
OL,13,Fentangled in netting, with almost half
OL,14,Fof them in the peak months of May,
OL,15,FJune and July.
OL,17,FThe charity's scientific officer said
OL,18,Funattended football and other netting
OL,19,Fcan trap, injure and kill wildlife and
OL,20,Fpets.

OL,6,FRebecca Machin said: "It's really
OL,7,Fimportant to put nets safely away when
OL,8,Fthey're not being used after the game
OL,9,Fis done.
OL,11,F"The problem is so serious that during
OL,12,Flast year's peak months, we dealt with
OL,13,F100 incidents of netting-entangled
OL,14,Ffoxes - mostly cubs.
OL,16,F"But it's not just foxes that are
OL,17,Faffected; other wild mammals like
OL,18,Fhedgehogs and deer, and even domestic
OL,19,Fpet mammals - including cats, can
OL,20,Fbecome potentially fatally entangled.

OL,6,FIn 2024 there were ten incidents of
OL,7,Fentangled animals in Northamptonshire,
OL,8,F13 in Bedfordshire, and 21 in
OL,9,FHertfordshire.
OL,11,FThe numbers were even greater in

OL,17,FThe charity's advice to the public is
OL,18,Fthat if a small animal is found caught
OL,19,Fup in netting but is uninjured, the
OL,20,Ffastest way to help it is to gently
OL,21,Fand carefully disentangle the animal.
