OL,6,FAn ex-offender says attempts to stamp
OL,7,Fout drugs in prison are merely
OL,8,F"dressing the wounds".
OL,10,FMike Thompson served 14 months in two
OL,11,Fprisons, including HMP Doncaster,
OL,12,Fwhich this week launched an operation
OL,13,Fto stop drugs being smuggled to
OL,14,Finmates.
OL,16,FSpecialist searches of 300 staff and
OL,17,Fvisitors were carried out and officers
OL,18,Fpatrolled the perimeter, including
OL,19,Fusing drones and search dogs.

OL,6,FMr Thompson, who was himself sentenced
OL,7,Ffor drug dealing, said such
OL,8,Finitiatives were not dealing with the
OL,9,Froot causes.
OL,11,F"From the perspective of the prisons,
OL,12,Fthey need to be seen to be doing

OL,15,F"But it is only dressing the wounds,
