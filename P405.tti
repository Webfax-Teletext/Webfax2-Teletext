OL,6,FDavid Lloyd in Southend is among clubs
OL,7,Fbuilding new padel courts to keep up

OL,10,FRacquets Manager Jon Lee said new
OL,11,Fplayers loved the game because the
OL,12,Fbasics were quick to learn.
OL,14,F"I think that padel has become popular
OL,15,Fbecause it's a lot easier to pick up
OL,16,Fthan a lot of other racquet sports,"
OL,17,FJon said.
OL,19,F"With tennis we have a lot of complex
OL,20,Fgrips, a lot of changes and a lot of
OL,21,Fpositions to play your shots.

OL,10,F"It's a lot easier to build rallies

OL,18,FThe courts are designed for doubles
