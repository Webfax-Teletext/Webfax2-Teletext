OL,6,FWales were beaten 22-15 by Italy in
OL,7,FRome on Saturday afternoon.
OL,9,FIt's a defeat that leaves head coach
OL,10,FWarren Gatland clinging to his job as
OL,11,Fthe losing run stretches out to 14
OL,12,Fmatches in a row.
OL,14,FGatland's side suffered a double blow
OL,15,Fbefore kick off when Liam Williams and
OL,16,FDafydd Jenkins pulled out an hour
OL,17,Fbefore the match due to a knee injury
