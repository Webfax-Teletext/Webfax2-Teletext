OL,7,FIn the tense final minutes of the
OL,8,FLionesses' Euros semi-final match
OL,9,Fagainst Italy, Chloe Kelly delivered
OL,10,FEngland's winning goal after the ball
OL,11,Frebounded off the keeper when she was
OL,12,Ftaking a penalty.
OL,14,FIt was a moment that left fans
OL,15,Fjubilant, but it could be outlawed
OL,16,Funder new proposals for the game.

OL,7,FThe proposals, which were first
OL,8,Freported in The Sun, would mean a
OL,9,Fmissed penalty would immediately
OL,10,Fresult in a goal kick for the
OL,11,Fdefending side, leaving no chance for
OL,12,Fplayers to score on the rebound.

OL,17,FInternational FA Board (Ifab).

OL,7,FIf approved, penalties would be
