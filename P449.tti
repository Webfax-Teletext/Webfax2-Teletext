OL,5,FThe Irish Open returns to Royal County
OL,6,FDown for the first time in nine years
OL,7,Fthis Thursday.
OL,9,FWhen the curtain comes down on Sunday
OL,10,Fafternoon, the winning golfer will
OL,11,Fhave played 72 holes of gruelling golf
OL,12,Fover four days in front of 16,000 fans
OL,13,Feach day.
OL,15,FHowever, for all of that to happen and
OL,16,Fto run smoothly, it requires a mammoth
OL,17,Feffort involving hundreds of staff and
OL,18,Fvolunteers.

OL,9,F"We will be starting at 4am each day

OL,5,FEammon also gives an insight into the
OL,6,Famount of people required to keep the
OL,7,Fcourse in great shape: "To get it
OL,8,Fready at the minute I have 18 full-
OL,9,Ftime staff and six temporary staff,
OL,10,Fcaddies and that helping us out, doing
OL,11,Fbunkers and divots and that there.
OL,13,F"Coming near the weekend we will be
OL,14,Fbringing in 20 staff from golf clubs
OL,15,Fall across Ireland."
OL,17,FLike all links courses, Royal County
OL,18,FDown is protected by a large amount of
OL,19,Fbunkers, and they require a lot of
OL,20,Feffort to keep them up to scratch.

OL,5,FEammon says the nature of the sand at
OL,6,Fthe course means it can often be blown
OL,7,Fout of the bunkers meaning the green
OL,8,Fstaff are constantly re-filling them:
OL,9,F"These last few days we have maybe put
OL,10,Fin 60-70 tonnes of sand in the
OL,11,Fbunkers."
OL,13,FDespite its timeless nature, the
OL,14,Fcourse has been subtly tweaked since
OL,15,Fthe Irish Open was last held here in
OL,16,F2015.

OL,9,Factually, we have got a great visual

OL,11,F8th hole and up the left hand side of
OL,12,Fthe 5th hole.
OL,14,F"We have done a little bit of work
