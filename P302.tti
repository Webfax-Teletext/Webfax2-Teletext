OL,10,Fsheer history of it. This is 56 years,
OL,11,For 70 years, of hurt we're talking
OL,12,Fabout. The Magpies lifting a trophy,
OL,13,Fespecially a major domestic trophy, is
OL,14,Fan event that's passing out of living

OL,17,FWould Newcastle fans know what to do

OL,6,FThese are all interesting questions to

OL,8,Fmore difficult, question. Can
OL,9,FNewcastle United win on Sunday? WILL
OL,10,FNewcastle United win on Sunday?
OL,12,FThe bookmakers will tell you it's
OL,13,Funlikely. Liverpool are strong
OL,14,Ffavourites and rightly so. They're the
OL,15,Fbest team in the land this season and,

OL,7,FFirst, Newcastle United aren't plucky
OL,8,Funderdogs here. This is not some David

OL,11,FEddie Howe's team are one of the
