OL,6,FThe Deaflympics begins this weekend,
OL,7,Fbut the journey there has not been
OL,8,Feasy for deaf athletes from across the
OL,9,FNorth West.
OL,11,FThe competition has been running for
OL,12,Fover 100 years, but those taking part
OL,13,Fhave said that it continues to be
OL,14,Fignored by the government.
OL,16,FGenevieve O'Hara who plays for GB's
OL,17,FDeaf Women's Football team said: "It's
OL,18,Fa dream for us to represent our
OL,19,Fcountry at the Olympics, however the
OL,20,Flack of government funding makes this
OL,21,Freally difficult to accomplish.

OL,7,Fsport in general could flourish, but
OL,8,Finstead we are stuck with the barrier
OL,9,Fof raising our own funds, which is so

OL,12,FGenevieve started playing football
OL,13,Fwhen she was three years old, inspired
OL,14,Fby her older brothers. When she found
