OL,7,FThe chief executive of the Football
OL,8,FAssociation has told ITV News that the
OL,9,FUK's bid to host the 2035 Women's
OL,10,FWorld Cup could "turbocharge women's
OL,11,Ffootball".
OL,13,FMark Bullingham said the FA had
OL,14,F"massive growth aspirations" for the
OL,15,Fsport, and played down the idea that
OL,16,Fhosting the tournament could help pave
OL,17,Fthe way for a men's World Cup bid in
OL,18,Fthe future.

OL,7,F"We think it's a really big event in
