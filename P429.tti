OL,6,FNewcastle United haven't won a trophy,
OL,7,Fespecially a major domestic trophy,
OL,8,Ffor well over 12 hours now.
OL,10,FThis is a better sentence than the 56/
OL,11,F70 year stuff.
OL,13,FIt was a wonderful moment to witness
OL,14,Fand an almost impossible moment to
OL,15,Funderstand. But let's come back to
OL,16,Fthat point.

OL,3,CSimon O'Rourke: Newcastle United's cup
OL,4,Cfinal win means so much to so many
OL,6,FThe first thing to say is Newcastle
OL,7,FUnited won because they were (by such
OL,8,Fa long, long way) the better team on
OL,9,Fthe day, against the best team of the
OL,10,Fseason.
OL,12,FThis was Eddie Howe's masterpiece. I
OL,13,Fcan't tell you how he reduced
OL,14,FLiverpool's biggest threats (Mo Salah
OL,15,Falso played in the 2025 Carabao Cup
OL,16,FFinal) to insignificance, but, well,
OL,17,Fthat's what happened.

OL,3,CSimon O'Rourke: Newcastle United's cup
OL,4,Cfinal win means so much to so many
OL,6,FThis was a complete win. The plan was
OL,7,Finspired and the execution was
OL,8,Fcomplete. Which brings us back to
OL,9,Fhistory. 56 years. 70 years.
OL,11,FIt's just such a long, long time.
OL,13,FBefore the match, I spoke to a man who
OL,14,Fcould barely get up Wembley Way for
OL,15,Ftears, because his Dad, a lifelong
OL,16,FNewcastle Fan, had passed away a few
OL,17,Fweeks ago.

OL,7,Ftold us they didn't know what to do or
OL,8,Fwhat to think. They had no frame of

OL,11,FLater, I spoke to a guy who lost his
OL,12,FMam a short while ago, but kept
OL,13,Ftexting her because it helped him feel

OL,16,FThis evening he sent her another
