OL,7,FIt was just a matter of hours after
OL,8,FNorwich City lost 2-1 at home to
OL,9,FLeicester that the club formally
OL,10,Fannounced Liam Manning had been given
OL,11,Fhis marching orders.
OL,13,FPerhaps not surprisingly, after the
OL,14,FCanaries became the first team in the
OL,15,Fhistory of the championship to lose
OL,16,Ftheir first seven home games.
OL,18,FIn a post-match press conference and
OL,19,Fbefore his sacking, Norwich-born
OL,20,FManning was asked whether that could
OL,21,Fspell the end for him.
