OL,7,FSteve Tandy's reign as Wales head
OL,8,Fcoach began with a 52-28 record defeat
OL,9,Fto Argentina on Sunday.
OL,11,FHis side looked lively in attack but

OL,7,FThe Welsh Rugby Union's proposed
OL,8,Fradical overhaul of the game in Wales
OL,9,F- a reduction from four to three
OL,10,Fprofessional clubs - has put the
OL,11,Flivelihoods of hundreds of players and
OL,12,Fstaff in jeopardy. Some of them were
OL,13,Fwearing red at the Principality
OL,14,FStadium on Sunday afternoon.
OL,16,FBut this game represented a new era
OL,17,Ffor the game here. It was Tandy's
OL,18,Ffirst game as the boss of the national
OL,19,Fside and in their last outing, Wales
OL,20,Fended a record 18-game losing streak
