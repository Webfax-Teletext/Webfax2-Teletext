OL,14,FI met her at her final training

OL,17,Ftrains and studies. Her mum Sharon is

OL,7,FIn our interview, the Loughborough
OL,8,Fathlete is smiley and relaxed but her
OL,9,Fproudest achievement was when she
OL,10,Fshowed fight to get a silver at the
OL,11,FEuropean U18s.
OL,13,FShe said: "I got shoved and pushed. I
OL,14,Fwas in the front the whole way. And
OL,15,Fthen the last bit, last 200m I went
OL,16,Finto fifth because I got tripped and
OL,17,Fthen with 200 to go I came back
OL,18,Faround, got pushed again back, and
OL,19,Fthen I ended up pulling it back into
OL,20,Fsecond. I think that's definitely the
OL,21,Fproudest achievement."
