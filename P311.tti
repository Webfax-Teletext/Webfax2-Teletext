OL,7,Fdormant for the majority of the year
OL,8,Ffeeling like a distant lump of rock,
OL,9,Fwaiting patiently for that annual
OL,10,Finflux of tourists in May.
OL,12,FBut for TT rider Nathan Harrison, the
OL,13,Fisland is much more than a race course.
OL,15,FWhile many competitors travel back to
OL,16,Ftheir respective homes at the end of
OL,17,Fthe festival, the local Manxman
OL,18,Ftravels mere minutes to settle back
OL,19,Finto island life.
