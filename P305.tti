OL,6,FBrian Cookson OBE, from Whalley,

OL,8,Fcycling, both as a competitor and as
OL,9,FPresident of British Cycling and Union

OL,11,Fworld governing body.
OL,13,FThe 74-year-old never thought that the

OL,15,Flast six decades could be harming his
OL,16,Fheart. But while he was training at
OL,17,FManchester Velodrome in May 2024,
OL,18,FBrian started to "feel unwell."
