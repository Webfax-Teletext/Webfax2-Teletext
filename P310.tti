OL,8,Fis "the biggest job in global sport":

OL,12,FHe said, "It's a movement that, one

OL,14,Fsince I first put a pair of running
OL,15,Fshoes on at the age of 11."
OL,17,F"I think that I've been in training
OL,18,Ffor this all my life", he continued.
OL,19,F"I'm probably better prepared for this
OL,20,Fthan anything I've ever endeavoured to
OL,21,Fdo in the past."
