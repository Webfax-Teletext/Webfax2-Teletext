OL,6,FJersey Sport said that following a
OL,7,Freview, they would end the playgroup
OL,8,Fnext month as the sessions cost
OL,9,F#70,000 a year to run, adding that it
OL,10,Fdoes not fall within their remit of
OL,11,Fsport.
OL,13,FResharing our previous story, Chief

OL,15,Fwas "surprised" to learn of Jersey
OL,16,FSport's decision, adding that the

OL,6,FDeputy Lyndon Farnham adds: "Jersey
OL,7,FSport is doing a good job focusing on

OL,12,FJersey Sport's CEO, David Kennedy,
OL,13,Fpreviously defended their decision
OL,14,Fsaying: "We know that there are other
