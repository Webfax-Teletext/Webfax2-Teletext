OL,6,FA couple say they don't want their
OL,7,Fhuge fossil collection to 'end up in a
OL,8,Fskip' after they die and have appealed
OL,9,Ffor help to find a new home for it.
OL,11,FAlan and Pauline Brown live in Kilve
OL,12,Fin Somerset and have spent around half
OL,13,Fa century collecting fossils from
OL,14,Fbeaches mainly in the county and in
OL,15,FDorset.
OL,17,FThe result of their efforts is a
OL,18,Fcollection numbering in the thousands
OL,19,Fcontaining everything from ammonites
OL,20,Fto ancient shark teeth.

OL,6,FThey hope that the collection can stay

OL,9,Fthe largest private collections in the
OL,10,Fcountry.
OL,12,FAlan said: "There's a tendency, I
OL,13,Fthink, for people in museums to come
OL,14,Fand look and sort of cherry pick, and
OL,15,Fwe'd like the collection to remain
OL,16,Fwhole."

OL,6,FAlan said there are many memories
OL,7,Fattached to each of the fossils,
OL,8,Fsaying: "You can look at these things
OL,9,Fand you're right back there in the
OL,10,Fday, the day you found it. You know
OL,11,Fwhere you were. You know what the
OL,12,Fweather was like."
OL,14,FPauline had been fascinated by fossils
OL,15,Fsince she was a child and had built up
OL,16,Fa lot of knowledge about them. The
OL,17,Fcouple still have the first fossil
OL,18,Fthey found together whilst on holiday.

OL,6,FShe said: "I'm not a sort of person
OL,7,Fwho can just lie on a beach. So the
OL,8,Ffirst thing to do is to have a poke
OL,9,Fabout and I think having found one or
OL,10,Ftwo, it just took off from there."
OL,12,FThe couple say they have always

OL,14,Fallowed to and have gathered them from
OL,15,Floose rocks and stones on beaches.
