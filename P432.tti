OL,6,FThe club has been much-loved by people

OL,6,F"Our reason to close is quite simple,
OL,7,FKingswood just does not have enough
OL,8,Ffoot traffic that would pay to operate
OL,9,Fsuch a large property.
OL,11,F"In decades past hundreds of people
OL,12,Fwere out beyond 10pm, today the high
OL,13,Fstreet may have only 60 to 100 people
OL,14,Fto share amongst every venue.
OL,16,F"Life is becoming expensive and
OL,17,Fhospitality has taken a huge impact
OL,18,Fbecause of that, pubs and clubs shut
OL,19,Feveryday and the industry is a
OL,20,Ffraction of what it once was.
