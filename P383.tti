OL,6,FThe Jersey Festival of Darts which saw
OL,7,Fsome of the biggest players compete on
OL,8,Fthe island, could be revived if the
OL,9,Ftournament can secure funding.
OL,11,FThe event has not taken place for a
OL,12,Fdecade and Jersey Darts are calling on
OL,13,Fthe government to assist with some
OL,14,Ffinancial support.
OL,16,FIt was an opportunity for both
OL,17,Fprofessionals and amateurs players to
OL,18,Fcompete against each other.

OL,6,FReflecting on festivals of the past,
OL,7,FJersey Darts player, Eddie Le Bailly
OL,8,Fsays: "It was actually the biggest pro-
OL,9,Fam tournament in the world.
OL,11,F"It was held up at Fort Regent and it
OL,12,Fwas always packed, it was a massive
OL,13,Ftournament for Jersey."
OL,15,FIn it's heyday the festival saw record-
OL,16,Fbreaking, 16-time World Champion, Phil
OL,17,FTaylor play on the island, who in 1999
OL,18,Fsaid: "The first round was as hard as
OL,19,Fthe last round, to be honest, it has
OL,20,Fbeen a great competition."

OL,10,FEddie got to play against Phil and
OL,11,Frecalls how good he was: "I played him
OL,12,Ftwice two years on the trot, I beat
OL,13,Fhim the first year, when he was World

OL,15,Fthe second time.
OL,17,F"It was a terrific games. He (Phil)
OL,18,Fwas who you wanted to play. You could

OL,20,Fyou would still want to play him."

OL,6,FGeneral Secretary of Jersey Darts,
OL,7,FStuart Moon says: "You just look at
OL,8,Fthis World Championship by itself and
OL,9,Fthere are eight players who have
OL,10,Fcompeted in it this year who competed
OL,11,Fin the Jersey Festival of Darts.
OL,13,F"It's important that these events do
OL,14,Fhappen. If you look at The Isle of Man
OL,15,Ffor instance, it is heavily funded by
OL,16,Ftheir government and they have 300 or
OL,17,F400 people turn up every year to play
